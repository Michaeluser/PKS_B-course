# TCP — Transmission Control Protocol

A practical, technical introduction to the transport layer with focus on TCP: connection establishment and teardown, reliable byte-stream delivery, timers and retransmissions, flow and congestion control, and selected extensions such as ECN and SACK.

# Transport Layer in Context

Transport provides **end-to-end** services on top of the network layer. It offers **multiplexing/demultiplexing** by ports and may be **connection-oriented** (TCP) or **connectionless** (UDP).

# TCP in the TCP/IP Stack

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** provides a **reliable, ordered, byte-stream** service, **connection-oriented** with acknowledgments.  
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** provides **connectionless, best-effort** delivery of individual datagrams.  
- Less common: **DCCP** (Datagram Congestion Control Protocol) for flows that need congestion control but not reliability.

<!-- note: Emphasize that applications choose between latency/overhead trade-offs. -->

## TCP Services

- **Reliable** delivery with positive ACKs and retransmissions  
- **Full-duplex**, point-to-point connection  
- **Flow control** (receiver window) and **congestion control** (cwnd)  
- **Stream orientation** (no message boundaries exposed to the app)  
- **Multiplexing** by <srcIP, srcPort, dstIP, dstPort>

::right::

## UDP at a Glance

- No connection setup; **stateless**  
- No reliability or ordering guarantees  
- Good for simple request/response, streaming, DNS, real-time media  
- App is responsible for any reliability/ordering if needed

# TCP Segment Structure

The TCP header includes ports, sequence and acknowledgment numbers, flags, window size, checksum, urgent pointer, and optional fields (e.g., **MSS**, **Window Scale**, **SACK Permitted**, **SACK blocks**).

# The Three-Way Handshake (SYN, SYN+ACK, ACK)

<img src="./images/l4-tcp_three_way_handshake.png" class="pt-5 h-90 float-center" />

<!--
```mermaid

    autonumber
    participant C as Client
    participant S as Server
    C->>S: SYN, Seq=A, (MSS, WS, SACK Permitted...)
    S- ->>C: SYN+ACK, Seq=B, Ack=A+1, (MSS, WS, SACK Permitted...)
    C->>S: ACK, Seq=A+1, Ack=B+1
    Note over C,S: Establish a full-duplex TCP connection with initial sequence numbers (ISNs).
    Note over C,S: State transitions: LISTEN → SYN-RECEIVED / SYN-SENT → ESTABLISHED.
```
-->


<!-- note: The SYN carries options such as MSS. Both sides advertise receive windows; scaling may also be negotiated here. -->

---

# TCP States Around Handshake

- **Server**: LISTEN → **SYN-RECEIVED** → **ESTABLISHED**  
- **Client**: **SYN-SENT** → **ESTABLISHED**  
- ISNs (A and B) protect against reordering and old duplicates; ACK confirms receipt of the peer’s ISN.

<!-- note: This directly maps to the classic “three-way handshake” diagrams used in protocol texts. -->

- <div text-red> Connection establishment timer </div>
Starts when a client sends a SYN packet to initiate a connection. If the timer expires before an acknowledgment is received, the sender retransmits the SYN packet. 

- <div text-red> Fin_Wait_2 timer </div>
he "finwait2 timer" refers to the FIN_WAIT_2 timer in TCP/IP networking, which dictates how long a system waits before forcibly closing a connection that is in the FIN_WAIT_2 state.
- <div text-red> Time_Wait timer (2MSL timer) </div>
Ensures the proper closure of a connection by keeping it in the TIME_WAIT state for twice the Maximum Segment Lifetime (2MSL).

<!-- The 2MSL timer is a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) timer that ensures the proper closure of a connection by keeping it in the TIME_WAIT state for twice the Maximum Segment Lifetime (2MSL). Its primary purpose is to prevent old, delayed packets from a previous connection from being mistakenly accepted as part of a new connection with the same IP addresses and port numbers. The timer starts after a TCP connection is actively closed and its duration is set by the implementation, with common values being 60 seconds (for a 2MSL of 120 seconds).

# Measuring RTT and Setting RTO

- TCP estimates **RTT** per connection; a smoothed value and variance are used to compute **RTO**, so that timeouts adapt to network conditions.  
- On timeout, the **unacknowledged** segment(s) are retransmitted; **duplicate ACKs** can also trigger fast retransmit (beyond today’s scope).  
- Practical impact: too small RTO ⇒ spurious retransmissions; too large ⇒ slow loss recovery.

<!-- note: Demo in Wireshark: follow TCP stream, inspect round-trip timing and retransmissions. -->

# Flow vs. Congestion Control

---
layout:default
---

# Flow Control (Receiver Window)

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A[Sender] -- Segments --> B[Receiver]
    B -- ACK + rwnd --> A
    A:::note -->|Limit send rate to min rwnd, cwnd | A
    classDef note stroke-dasharray: 5 5;
```

- The receiver advertises **rwnd** (receive window) to avoid overrunning its buffer.  
- Sender must respect rwnd: in-flight bytes ≤ rwnd.  
- Zero-window situations trigger the **persistence timer** (probing for space).

---

# Congestion Control (Congestion Window)

```mermaid {scale: 0.5}
flowchart TB 
    start([Start]) --> ss[Slow Start: cwnd grows exponentially]
    ss --> ca[Congestion Avoidance: cwnd grows linearly]
    ca --> loss{Loss detected?}
    loss -->|Timeout| reset[Reduce cwnd, retransmit; reset to 1 MSS]
    loss -->|Dup ACKs| fr[Fast Retransmit/Recovery]
    fr --> ca
```

- Sender maintains a **cwnd** reflecting its view of the path capacity.  
- Typical behavior: **slow start** initially, then **congestion avoidance**; on loss, reduce cwnd and recover.  
- Flow control (rwnd) and congestion control (cwnd) interact: effective window = min(rwnd, cwnd).

<!-- note: Modern TCP variants (CUBIC, BBR) refine growth/response; out of scope for this lecture. -->

# Error Control (ARQ Family)

---
layout:default
---

# Feedback-Based ARQ

- **ACK-based (P-scheme)**, **NAK/REJ-based (N-scheme)**, or **combined (A-scheme)**.  
- **Block (idle)** vs. **continuous** sending strategies.  
- TCP uses continuous ARQ with selective mechanisms (SACK) when negotiated.

---

# Block ARQ — A-scheme (simple)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Sender
    participant R as Receiver
    S->>R: Block i
    R-->>S: ACK i
    S->>R: Block i+1
    R-->>S: ACK i+1
    Note over S,R: A lost ACK leads to retransmission after timeout.
```

---

# Continuous Selective ARQ — A-scheme

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Sender
    participant R as Receiver
    S->>R: Frames i, i+1, i+2, i+3 ...

    S->>R: Retransmit i+2
```

    R-->>S: NAK at i+k
    S->>R: Retransmit i+k, i+k+1, ... (go back)
    Note over S,R: Inefficient when single loss occurs in a long window.
```

# ECN and TCP Extensions

---

# ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification)

![ECN Field](./images/l4-ecn_field.png)

- Network marks congestion (**CE**) instead of dropping; endpoints must react (reduce cwnd).  
- TCP flags: **ECE** (ECN-Echo) and **CWR** (Congestion Window Reduced); **NS** (Nonce Sum, historic).  
- Benefits: can avoid loss when queues fill, improving latency under load.

<!-- note: ECN requires support in endpoints and along the path (or at least not remarking ECN bits). -->

---

# Common TCP Options

- **MSS** (Maximum Segment Size): negotiated in SYN to avoid IP fragmentation.  
- **Window Scale**: extends window beyond 65,535 bytes for high BDP paths.  
- **SACK Permitted** and **SACK blocks**: allow selective acknowledgment for efficient loss recovery.  
- **Timestamp option**: improves RTT estimation and PAWS (Protection Against Wrapped Sequence numbers).

<!-- note: Revisit in labs; observe options in SYN/SYN+ACK with Wireshark. -->

---
layout: default
---

# Worked Byte-Stream Example

- Application writes 4,500 bytes. TCP segments into ~3 × 1500B payloads (MSS-dependent).  
- Sequence numbers advance by bytes sent; ACK number = next expected byte.  
- After data exchange, teardown proceeds via FIN/ACK handshake and TIME-WAIT.

<!-- note: Connect to the earlier Slovak slide: SN=111, ACK transitions, three 1500B data segments. -->

---
layout: default
---

# Summary

**Key takeaways:**  
- TCP is a **reliable, ordered, full-duplex byte stream** on top of IP.  
- The **three-way handshake** establishes state and negotiates options.  
- **Timers** (RTT→RTO, persistence, delayed ACK, TIME-WAIT) govern reliability and liveness.  
- **Flow control** (rwnd) protects receivers; **congestion control** (cwnd) protects the network.  
- **Extensions** like ECN, SACK, window scaling improve robustness and performance.

<!-- note: For practice, analyze a PCAP of an HTTP transaction; locate SYN→SYN+ACK→ACK, options, and teardown. -->
